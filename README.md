I built a responsive landing page that replicates the design provided in the Figma reference. The page includes:

A header with logo and a clear call-to-action button.

Three information sections with images and supporting text to highlight product features.

A simple contact form for user interaction.

A fully mobile-responsive layout to ensure usability across devices.

Google Analytics integration using the embed code, allowing tracking of user activity and page performance.
Finally, I deployed the site on my Webflow subdomain for easy access and testing.
